      <p>CPAD stands for Computer-generated plus-shape architectural designs. It is written in computer language Processing.</p>

<p>Given a set of data (number of rooms, area of each room, adjacency relation among the rooms given in terms of weighted adjacency matrix), CPAD generates a plus shape floor plan and its adjacency graph. Other shape floor plans can also be generated by making small changes in the code.</p>

<p>The plus-shape floor plans are generated by adjoining 5 different rectangular blocks. These rectangular blocks are formed on the basis of weighted adjacency matrix and they are one of the best connected arrangements of rectangular pieces inside a rectangle.</p>

<p>By making small changes in the input.txt file, about 4 million different plus shape floor plans can be generated for a given set of data. Therefore, for the classification of obtained solutions, CPAD computes some graph covariants which can be found in output.txt file.</p>

<p>The following libraries are required to run the code. Jama jgrapht controlP5 gicentreUtils</p>
